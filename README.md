Text data in tabular form. The table is made up with 1 header line and multiple lines of data.

The last column of data is kind of summary of a given row, and it is always visible, i.e. if the table does not fit horizontally on the screen, this column is always visible at the right edge of the screen and does not scroll horizontally. If the table fits entirely on the screen, the column behaves like the other columns and is an integral part table.

Additionally, after clicking on the table header, the data is sorted alphabetically according to the values in the column you clicked.

The user gets the impression that the operation is being performed by animating the appearance of sorted data.
